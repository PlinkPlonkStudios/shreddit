# Shreddit: Reddit for shredded cheese

This is a toy full-stack project that I'm creating to practice and strengthen my
skills in full-stack development (following [this](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8)
video).

My project will be different from the video in that I'll use MongoDB instead of
PostgreSQL and React Native instead of React.
